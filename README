The script calculate_variability.py take the input fasta and the directory to save all of the output files as input
and makes:
    csv file to plot variable region (variability.csv)
    start and stop positions of the variable regions (variable_regions.txt)
    edge file for full 16S rRNA for the first subset of 100 sequences to make the pylogentic tree (full_sequence_edges.txt)
    edge file for the first variable region to make the phylogenetic tree (first_variable_region_edges.txt)
    fasta file for the first variable region (first_variable_region.fasta)
    edge file for the fourth variable region to make the phylogenetic tree (fourth_variable_region_edges.txt)
    fasta file for the fourth variable region (fourth_variable_region_tree.pdf)
    tip labels for the R script to make the phylogenetic tree (hw4_tip_labels.txt)
Usage:
    python calculate_variability.py -i {inputFastaFile} -o {outputDirectory}

The plot_variability.R will take the variability.csv file and create the plot of sequence identity across the 16S rRNA
sequence (variability.pdf). A vertical red line at 75% is drawn to show the variable regions that falls below the line.
75% was chosen because with 4 nucleotides there is 25% chance of any nucleotide to be at that sequence by chance.
Chance of any 3 nucleotides to be at that position is up to 75%, therefore if the sequence identity at the given
position is greater than 75%, the sequence is conserved.
Usage:
    Rscript plot_variability.R ./variability.csv

The hw3-plot-edges.r script from homework 3 is used to create the phylogeneic tree using the edges.txt file for the
corresponding regions (full sequence, first variable region and the fourth variable region). The output file is named
tree.pdf and needs to be renamed before executing for other regions, otherwise the output tree pdf file will be
overwritten.
Usage:
    Rscript hw3-plot-edges.r {region_of_interest}_edges.txt hw4_tip_labels.txt
